            <p>This website serves as a way to help realize the amount and types of data that can be collected on a social media site. This is a very conservative estimate, seeing as most sites also have videos, stories, comments, saves, shares, and many more features and interactions that can be tracked.</p>
            <h2>What does this have to do with AI?</h2>
            <p>Social platforms like Facebook and YouTube used to use simple algorithms that generated a sort of 'engagement score' based on various variables they tracked, such as likes or watch time. Nowadays, however, they use machine learning to recognize patterns and develope personality profiles for each user.</p>
            <p>FaceBook started off with EdgeRank which used a simple mathematical algorithm and few variables like likes, shares, and time information. More and more variables were added and eventually machine learning was introduced, to the point where they now entirely rely on machine learning instead of EdgeRank and even use it for their ad services.</p>
            <p>YouTube also started with a simple algorithm based on likes and watch time, but switched to a deep learning algorithm in 2016 that is able to reconize patterns in the types of content users view and reccomend videos based on those patterns.</p>
            <p>Tristan Harris, a tech entrepeneur who worked at Google and briefly Instagram (and also starred in Netflix's <i>The Social Dilemna</i> documentary) left the company based on concerns about how accurately these companies were able to generate personality profiles of their users based on all the data that was unknowingly being collected. He helped co-found the Center of Humane Technology to spread awareness.</p>
            <h2>What can this data be used for?</h2>
            <p>Machine learning algorithms can analyze this data to identify patterns in the types of content the user engages with the most. They can do this by taking into account post genre, user likes / unlikes, post view times, and scroll speed. An algorithm can identify which posts genres or profiles the user engages with the most and keep reccomending those types of posts in order to maximize the time spent on the site.</p>
            <p>While most social platform companies will say they are doing this to create a more connected world, it's important to note that the longer a user spends on their platforms, the more money they make due to ads. There is valid economic reasoning for increasing user engagement time on their platforms using increasingly more accurate and comprehensive machine learning algorithms.</p>
